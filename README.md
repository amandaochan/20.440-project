### Overview
This repo contains the code to analyze the RNA seq data in "Epigenetic dysregulation of naive CD4+ T-cell activation genes in childhood food allergy", Martino et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05608-4). 

### Data
The data was generated by profiling methylation and gene expression of naive CD4+ T cells from infants with and without egg allergy. Naive CD4+ T cells were obtained from cohort infants, stimulated, and profiled for genome-wide methylation and gene expression at age 1 (baseline) and at age 2 or 4 (follow-up), by which around 60% of infants in the allergy group had outgrown their allergy. 

The data is available on the Gene Expression Omnibus repository with the primary accession code GSE114135.
