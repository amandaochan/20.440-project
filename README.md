### Overview
This repo contains the code to analyze the RNA seq data in "Epigenetic dysregulation of naive CD4+ T-cell activation genes in childhood food allergy", Martino et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05608-4). 

### Data
The data was generated by profiling methylation and gene expression of naive CD4+ T cells from infants with and without egg allergy. Naive CD4+ T cells were obtained from cohort infants, stimulated, and profiled for genome-wide methylation and gene expression at age 1 (baseline) and at age 2 or 4 (follow-up), by which around 60% of infants in the allergy group had outgrown their allergy. 

The data is available on the Gene Expression Omnibus repository with the primary accession code GSE114135.

The purpose of the folders is as follows:
* **data/raw/**: raw data from the authors, downloaded from GEO
* **data/processed/**: intermediate data during processing
* **data/results/**: our results from our code (not yet populated in Git)
* **fig/main_fig/**: our main figures generated from our code
* **fig/supp_fig/**: our supplementary figures generated from our code (not yet populated in Git)
* **notebook/**: Jupyter notebooks for initial data visualization and exploration (not yet populated in Git)
* **src/analysis/**: code for producing results (not yet populated in Git)
* **src/data_processing/**: code for loading and processing the authors' data
* **src/util/**: helper functions and reused scripts (not yet populated in Git)
* **src/visualization/**: code for plotting results


### Installation
#### Setup
Create a virtual environment using Anaconda and navigate to that environment. Install pip:
```
conda create --name myenv
conda activate myenv
conda install pip
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages using the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running code
To generate Table 1, navigate to the main project directory and run:
```
python .\src\data_processing\process_raw_data.py
python .\src\visualization\generate_table1.py
```

"Table1.png" will be generated and stored in the folder "figs/main_figs".
